**DataSet**

Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce burden on doctors.
Content
This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Target" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patients (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.
Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90".

Problem Statement

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-Create a predictive model with implementation of  different classifiers on liver patient diseases dataset to predict liver diseases.

Task3:- Create an analysis to show on what basis you have designed your model.  

**Conclusion**
   - XG Boosting and Random Forest exhibited the best performance with ROC AUC scores of 71% and 95%, respectively.
   - Logistic regression, Decision Tree, and SVM also provided reasonable accuracy.
   - Considered factors such as sensitivity, specificity, and overall ROC curve shape for model selection.
   - The project successfully addressed the problem of liver disease prediction using a liver patient dataset. Through detailed data analysis and the implementation 
     of various classifiers, we gained insights into the dataset's characteristics. The models showed varying levels of accuracy and performance, with Random Forest 
     and XGBoosting demonstrating higher efficacy. The ROC curves provided a visual representation of the models' ability to distinguish between positive and 
     negative instances. The analysis contributes to building a predictive model for liver disease, offering potential benefits for early diagnosis and intervention.
